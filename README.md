World Happiness Report Analysis 2005-2024 using (R Markdown &amp; Tableau)

The World Happiness Report 2024 aims to measure and rank countries based on various factors that contribute to their happiness and well-being. In My analysis, I will analyze the World Happiness Report dataset from 2005 - 2024 using R and Tableau for data manipulation and visualization.

My goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors that influence happiness around the globe for the years 2005-2024 using R Markdown and Tableau.
